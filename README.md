# tjctf-1516-released
This repository contains distributed problem files for TJCTF 2016. You can use
these to help you with writeups.

Problem descriptions and correct flags can be found in the `problem.yml` for
each problem. If this repository is missing anything you need to complete
writeups, email us at `ctf@tjhsst.edu`.

Thanks for playing TJCTF!
